The following files are associated with this project:
1. data.csv contains the connectome with prediction results.
2. The script "sign-pred" contains the R code for some calculations
3. The script "search tool" contains an R code for individual search 

To run the scripts, you need to import data.csv as "data". Then, "sign-pred" will calculate parameters. 
Using the "search tool" you can search for predictions for individual connections.
