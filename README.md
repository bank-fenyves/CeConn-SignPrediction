This project "CeConn-SignPrediction" contains materials to the following paper:

B. G. Fenyves, G. S. Szilágyi, Z. Vassy, C. Sőti, P. Csermely (2020) Synaptic polarity and sign-balance prediction using gene expression data in the Caenorhabditis elegans chemical synapse neuronal connectome network. PLOS Computational Biology 16(12): e1007974.

The following files are associated with this project:
1. data.csv contains the connectome with prediction results.
2. The script "sign-pred" contains the R code for some calculations
3. The script "search tool" contains an R code for individual search 

To run the scripts, you need to import data.csv as "data". Then, "sign-pred" will calculate parameters. 
Using the "search tool" you can search for predictions for individual connections.
